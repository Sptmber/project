<h1>Science Project</h1><p><em>Elvin Rosic | 2020</em></p><hr /><h2>The types of waves:</h2><p>There are three types of waves: transverse, longtitudinal, and surface. <br /> <br /> <br /> <strong>Transverse:</strong> <br /> <tt>Transverse waves are basic. They form from some kind of mechanical motion, such as a vibration. The primary characteristics of a transverse wave are the resting point, crest, trough, wavelength, amplitude, and frequency (in hz).</tt> <br /> <br /> <strong>Longtitudinal:</strong> <br /> <tt>Longtitudinal waves are similar to transverse waves because they have an amplitude, resting point, etc; except the wavelength and frequency is not constant. The frequency alternates between low and high. When the wave's frequency gets higher, it is called a compression. Alternatively, when the frequency gets lower it's called a rarefaction.</tt> <br /> <br /> <tt>An good example of an object that represents a longtitudinal wave is a spring </tt> <br /> <br /> <strong>Surface:</strong> <br /> <tt>Surface waves are simply waves that separate two things, like an ocean wave. Their characteristics include the crest, trough, etc.</tt></p><hr /><p>&nbsp;<img src="unnamed.gif"></p><p><br /> F: Crest - the highest point of the wave <br /> H: Trough - the lowest point of the wave <br /> G: Amplitude - the energy of the wave <br /> J: Wavelength - the length from one wave to another</p><hr /><p><img src="funny.gif"></p><p><br /> The area which the waves are close together is the compression. <br /> The more "loose" area is the rarefaction</p><hr /><p><img src="funzone.gif" width="10%" height="10%"><br>The surface wave creates a separation between the water and the air. <br /> Notice the compressions and rarefactions in the image.</p><hr /><h2><u>Terms:</u></h2><p><strong>Frequency:</strong> the rate of how often something happens within a certain timespan.</p><p><strong>Hertz:</strong> measure of how many waves pass through within a second.</p><p><strong>Crest:</strong> the highest point in a wave <br /> <br /> <strong>Trough:</strong> the lowest point in a wave <br /> <br /> <strong>Resting Point:</strong> a line in equidistance from the crest and trough; the middle of the wave. <br /> <br /> <strong>Wavelength:</strong> the length from one wave to the next <br /> <br /> <strong>Rarefaction:</strong> the lower frequency area of a wave <br /> <br /> <strong>Compression:</strong> the higher frequency area of a wave</p>
